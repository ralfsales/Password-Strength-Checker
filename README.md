Password Strength Checker üîè
The Password Strength Checker is a Python-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. It evaluates the security of a password and provides feedback based on predefined criteria to help users create strong and secure passwords.

Key Features
Strength Evaluation:
Checks if the password is at least 8 characters long.
Verifies the presence of:
Uppercase and lowercase letters.
Digits.
Special characters (@#$%^&+=).
Detects common patterns (e.g., "password," "12345") that weaken security.
User-Friendly Interface:
Clean and intuitive GUI built with Tkinter.
Input masking for password fields with a toggle to show/hide the password.
Real-Time Feedback:
Displays a clear strength evaluation (e.g., Weak or Strong) based on user input.
How It Works
Enter a password in the input field.
Click "Check Strength" to analyze the password.
View feedback on the strength of the password and tips for improvement.
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for functionality.
Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface.
Regular Expressions (re): For pattern matching and password analysis.
Future Enhancements
Add support for multilingual feedback.
Implement advanced security checks (e.g., dictionary attacks).
Integrate with external APIs to test passwords against known data breaches.
This project demonstrates practical applications of Python and Tkinter while emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity and user education.
